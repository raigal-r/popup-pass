# MultiSig DeleGator Smart Contract

### Overview

The MultiSigDeleGator is a Solidity smart contract that extends the functionality of the DeleGatorCore contract. It facilitates multi-signature based access control and delegation. All signers are externally owned accounts (EOAs).

### Features

Multi-Signature Support: Enables multi-signature transactions with a flexible threshold.

Delegation: Allows for delegation of transaction execution to other accounts.

The minimum threshold of signatures must be obtained to execute a transaction.

Signatures must be sorted in ascending order by the address of the signer.

### Signer Management

The contract provides functions to manage signers:

- Replace Signer: Replace an existing signer with a new one.

- Add Signer: Add a new signer to the contract.

- Remove Signer: Remove a signer from the contract.

- Update Threshold: Adjust the threshold for executing transactions.
